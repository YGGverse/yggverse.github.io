# Yo! search for Gemini Protocol

Just created Yo! branch oriented for Gemini space

=> https://github.com/YGGverse/Yo/tree/gemini

At this moment under development, we hope to launch online crawler soon.

Yo! is the super thin client-server crawler based on Manticore full-text search server.

It written in PHP 8 / Composer, includes flexible settings, page history snaps, CLI tools for administration and simple JS-less UI (in original build)

Probably, Gemini interface will be implemented using Titan-II server fork with better IPv6 support (as we're from Yggdrasil)

Also, working on gemini-php library as the dependency:
