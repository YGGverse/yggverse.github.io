## Example

``` php
$request = new \Yggverse\Gemini\Client\Request(
    'gemini://yggverse.cities.yesterweb.org:1965/index.gmi' // target URL
    '68.133.1.71' // resolved IP, skip to use system-wide resolver
);
```

Alternatively, use setResolvedHost method of Request object before getResponse

$request->setResolvedHost(
    '68.133.1.71'
)
